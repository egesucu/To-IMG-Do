# To-IMG-Do
a To-Do app with some Images, written in Swift4

This app is used as the Course Project and is aimed to show to the people.

The app is using Core Data with some NSPredicate in order to filter the results. The user may swipe left or right to
remove  or mark an entry as done. The removed one will be deleted from the DB and the marked one will show in other Page

The code also uses custom swipe gestures and options. The user creates a note with an image and when the user touch the cell, 
it will see a detail page where thumbnail image increased as a bigger image.
